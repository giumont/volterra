# Volterra Predator-Prey Simulator in C++
**Author:** *Giulia Montagnani*  

This project implements a **numerical simulation** of the *Lotka‚ÄìVolterra predator-prey model* in C++.  
The simulation uses a **discrete method** to solve the coupled differential equations over a specified time interval, and generates output files that represent the **evolution of the populations**.

For detailed theoretical explanations, please refer to the [*Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) or to any standard textbook on differential equations.

### Interactive Version
This branch includes a proposal for an **interactive and looped menu**, where the program does not terminate automatically when an invalid input is entered.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** this version is *not yet complete/fully documented*. It is recommended to use the **guideline-version** branch.

### Report (Guideline Version)
You can download the full **report** in PDF, which contains:  
- a detailed explanation of the **code design**,  
- examples of the **expected outputs**,  
- and a **step-by-step guide** to run the program.
