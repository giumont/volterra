# Volterra Predator-Prey Simulator in C++
**Author:** *Giulia Montagnani*  

This project implements a **numerical simulation** of the *Lotkaâ€“Volterra predator-prey model* in C++.  
The simulation uses a **discrete method** to solve the coupled differential equations over a specified time interval, and generates output files that represent the **evolution of the populations**.

For detailed theoretical explanations, please refer to the [*Lotkaâ€“Volterra equations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) or to any standard textbook on differential equations.

### Guideline Version
The project in this branch follows, as closely as possible, the **guidelines** specified for an exam project.
<!--*"Programming for Physics"* of the *Physics Degree at the University of Bologna (2024â€“2025)*.--> 

You can download the full **report** in PDF, which contains:  
- a detailed explanation of the **code design**,  
- examples of the **expected outputs**,  
- and a **step-by-step guide** to run the program.
